# Randomize.scss

A small collection of functions and mixins to help you make the most out of Sass's built-in `random()` function.

It makes otherwise-frustrating tasks like [randomly animating SVGs with dozens of elements](http://codepen.io/mknadler/pen/EaWeeo) simple to implement.

[Here's (almost) everything that you can do with it](http://codepen.io/mknadler/full/LEyxxG/).

Stuck? [Check out the docs](http://mknadler.github.io/randomize.scss/).

## How To Install

`bower install randomize.scss`, `git clone`, or simply copy-and-paste the contents of the `sass/` folder.

## Questions?

More will be added soon; in the meantime, please feel free to request specific features, make a PR, or [get in touch](https://twitter.com/antimytheme).
