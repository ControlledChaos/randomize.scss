# Randomize.scss

A small collection of functions and mixins to help you make the most out of Sass's built-in `random()` function.

What can you do with it? [Here are](http://codepen.io/mknadler/pen/QwdQBx) [some examples](http://codepen.io/mknadler/pen/rajpJp).

Stuck? [Check out the docs](http://mknadler.github.io/randomize.scss/).

More will be added soon; in the meantime, please feel free to request specific features, make a PR, or [get in touch](https://twitter.com/antimytheme).

## How To Use

First, install it, either via `bower install randomize.scss`, `git clone`, or simply copy-and-pasting. I won't judge.
